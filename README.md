Everyday we come across many grievances with our public service system and though we want to lodge a complaint to the concerned authorities we seldom do so because of the tedious red tape involved with it. UCOMPLAIN provides an online tool to solve problems faced by common public by saving time and demolishing the bridge of officers between the concerned authorities and the public.
The primary objective is to make complaints easier to coordinate, monitor, track and resolve. In the era of Facebookâ€™s like button influencing billions of people we are implementing a similar button to help a single complaint have thousand voices.
A customer can file a complaint by filling in the details. They can also view and respond to other complaints within their interests. It is also possible to add pictures which can much more easily show the severity of the situation. The complaint is forwarded to the concerned authorities on the basis of type of complaint. This helps in avoiding long queues for logging a complaint and helps in resolving the problem faced by people.
